Tell stories using data
	start with business problem
		losing customers

		product sales dropping

	stories need data

		pull and prepare data


tip #1 don't underestimate the time needed to collect and prepare the data

tip #2 use aggregate and statistic functions to understand your data
	- you can get a picture for the data and see any outliers that might help you craft your story around the business problem

tip #3 reformat and check data quality before attempting joins
	- use consistent naming conventions
	- use constraints on tables if needed to make sure data is coming in clean 

tip #4
	- remember to use the appropriate join
tip #5 Use views to store complex SQL logic
	- create views to easily access data again
	- save your queries
tip #6 use cubes, rollups for multiple aggregations
	- when you need to produce cross tabulations and subtotals - this is your tool
		- you could use a bunch of select statements to get the same result 
			- but that makes it difficult when the data set is big and it opens you up to possibly making a mistake
tip #7 use window functions to work with groups of data
	- they help us focus on sets of related rows
		- this simplifies queries that would require very complex subqueries
